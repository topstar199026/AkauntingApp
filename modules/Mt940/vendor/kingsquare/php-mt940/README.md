# php-mt940?
The php-mt940 package provides a lightweight parser for [MT940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT940) format which is used by [SWIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT). The output
is transformed into easy to use dataclasses Transaction_banking which itself contains Statement_banking objects. Pretty
straight forward.

## Requirements
* At least PHP 7

## Installation
If composer is not yet on your system, follow the instructions on [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) to do so.

To add this dependency to your project, simply run the following command from the root of your project:

``` composer require kingsquare/php-mt940 ```

This ensures that you install the latest stable release.

## How to use the parser?
I've attached a simple script in the examples directory to explain it a bit more in detail, but after loading the
required classes, the usage should be pretty simple:

```php
<?php
// ... load everything ... //

// instantiate the actual parser
// and parse them from a given file, this could be any file or a posted string
$parser = new \Kingsquare\Parser\Banking\Mt940();
$tmpFile = __DIR__.'/test.mta';
$parsedStatements = $parser->parse(file_get_contents($tmpFile));
?>
```
### Included engines
Currently the following engines are included:

- ABNAMRO ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Abn.php))
- ING ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Ing.php))
- KNAB ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Knab.php))
- RABOBANK ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Rabo.php))
- SPARKASSE ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Spk.php))
- TRIODOS ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Triodos.php))
- HSBC ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Hsbc.php))
- SNS ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Sns.php)) **Experimental**
- BUNQ ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Bunq.php))
- PENTA ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Penta.php))
- ASN ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Asn.php))
- KBS ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Kbs.php))
- ZETB ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Zetb.php))
- KONTIST ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Kontist.php))
- a default `UNKNOWN`-engine ([here](./src/Parser/Banking/Mt940/Engine/Unknown.php))

### Custom engines
To override engines or just try a one-off engine on a file, you can pass an engine into the `parse`-method:

```php
<?php
// ... load everything ... //

class MyCustomMt940Engine extends \Kingsquare\Parser\Banking\Mt940\Engine {
    // add your overrides / overloads and custom logic here
}

// instantiate the actual parser
// and parse them from a given file, this could be any file or a posted string
$parser = new \Kingsquare\Parser\Banking\Mt940();
$engine = new MyCustomMt940Engine();
$tmpFile = __DIR__.'/test.mta';
$parsedStatements = $parser->parse(file_get_contents($tmpFile), $engine);
?>
```

## Known issues
I've provided unittests but please take a look at the github issue tracker for the latest ideas's, issues or other stuff..

## Future plans
I do intend to add new engines or keep everything running smoothly, but since i don't have access to any more test files, it's hard to add new engines ;) The `unknown` engine should work or atleast give some idea as to where different banks diverge from the standard. If you do have any ideas, examples or new banks that you'd like to see incorporated, please don't hesitate and send me an issue / pullrequest!
